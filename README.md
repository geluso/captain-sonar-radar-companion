<p>
A free, ad-free, Andriod app to be used in conjuction with playing Captain Sonar.
This tool assists the Radar operator by computing possible submarine positions according to their
movements, their actions, and reconnaissance.

<p>
Captain Sonar is a great board game where players act as submarines hunting each other down.
Players play on identical maps with their own submarines hidden from each other. Each player
takes turns moving their sub around the map and they must announce the movements their making.
Each play listens to the enemy's movements and tries to track them down by tracing their path
and figuring out where they might be on the map without the path they've heard running over
islands.
</p>

<p>
In addition to movement, players have special actions available to them. Each action
requires movement to charge up before it can be used. There's two reconnaissance actions
that reveal information about the enemy's location. There's one evasive action which allows
a player to move their sub without telling the enemy which way they've gone. And, of course,
there's destructive actions players can charge up to lay mines and fire torpedoes to
try to destroy each other.
</p>

<p>
Normally players track the enemy sub with an erasable marker, drawing the enemy's path on
a transparent piece of plastic. This app strives to be used in conjunction with the traditional
marker to speed-up, verify, and augment the traditional Radar role.

<p>
Why would anyone want to use this app?
</p>

<ul>
<li>Just for fun.</li>
<li>First-time Radar operators.</li>
<li>To speed up play time, especially in 1-vs-1 turn-based games.</li>
<li>To track your own sub to see what the enemy sees.</li>
<li>Multi-sub matches with Radar tracking subs on multiple frequencies.</li>
<li>You've admitted to yourself the Radar role is ultimately algorithmic.</li>
</ul>
